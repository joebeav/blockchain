       " '[Bitcoin Code Report](http://www.dasbitcoin.com/)\\n\\nMission Statement\\n\\nThe nature of development work is ongoing and challenging, and very often thankless. Developers regularly work night and day to monitor and improve their respective clients, bringing their users the best possible experience. And in the bitcoin world, this is especially important. The bitcoin community as a whole is quite small relative to other economic communities, and user optimization is key. Without the original bitcoin client software provided by Satoshi, and its numerous branchings since, we wouldn’t have the software to function, let alone thrive. And without the miners and enthusiasts utilizing such software to maintain and validate the blockchain, this community could not, and would not, exist.\\n\\nThere exist individuals who are versed in the multitudes of coding languages who are capable of understanding the efforts of the different development teams building bitcoin client software with scant effort on their parts. But, for those less versed in code, topical viewing of bitcoin client development is essentially, (and in the programming sense: literally), akin to reading a foreign language one has no knowledge of.\\n\\nThis is a critical problem, as the work being performed in the name of bitcoin directly affects every user tied to the bitcoin ecosystem. Whether an individual may be a software developer, an enthusiast, a miner, a business owner, an entrepreneur, or the simplest of laymen, the different bitcoin clients are directly correlated to the experience and prosperity of each. However, it is important to note that this correlation between client software and bitcoin user occurs whether the user understands it or not. And for this reason, it is the responsibility of every user of bitcoin, no matter the level of their passion or investment, to possess a certain level of understanding towards the development work currently occurring, as it were, under the hood.\\n\\nThis problem is challenging however. This isn’t so much a “lost in translation” situation as it is a “lack of translation” issue. Short of every person seeking to join the bitcoin sphere learning a handful of programming languages, an effort towards highlighting and interpreting the plethora of coding being performed is crucial.\\n\\nThese code reports represent that effort to bring the various complicated, and all too frequently convoluted, code changes and commitments that the major bitcoin client developers are making every day into the spotlight, and interpreting them into plainer english. Public knowledge is key to an informed ecosystem, and now more than ever, it is crucial to understand the various clients, and their individual stances and focuses taken upon bitcoin’s future.',\n",

Last estimates were  ~$28T USD in flag M0 being available at Layer 2 worldwide, not all denominated in USD.

Trade wars might also exist between States that allow cryptocurrencies and those that done.

It is all about timing of cryptocurrencies gracefully eaking their way in way into States without threatening States around the time of the \"big reset\".\\n\\nWhat States need to recognize is that micro accounting cyclic executive patterns (associated fiat flag currency income tax systems) are an order of magnitude less efficient than event driven patterns.

       " '\"Transactions are keyed to phases\" means that when I create a transaction, I must select which phase may validly mine the transaction.\\n\\nLet\\'s say you are an A-miner, and an A-block is mined. Now what do you do? Do you power down your hardware until a valid B-block is mined? Once a valid B-block is mined, you must validate it before you can start mining, which puts you at a disadvantage, especially if the block interval is only 5 minutes.\\n\\nIt would be great if you could just start mining the next A-block immediately. You could mine an empty A-block immediately, because you have the previous A-block header, and the B-block header immediately before it... However, you do not know which transactions are about to be included in the B-block currently under construction. If you duplicate their work, you will not be paid for it.\\n\\nThis last problem goes away if roughly half of the mem-pool cannot be mined by B-miner. You stay away from those transactions and you are probably pretty safe.\\n\\nAs for big miners rendering their previous investment void -- I don\\'t think that is any problem. Mining equipment is obsolete very quickly. Just give everyone enough runway and a gradual cut-over and it will be fine.\\n\\nThe much bigger (insurmountable?) problem would be getting consensus on a hard fork, but I have a suspicion that a change like this could be done with a clever soft fork, since apparently almost anything can.\\n\\n',\n",
