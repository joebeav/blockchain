Just as a gold coin\\'s value is thought to be underpinned by the value of the raw gold needed to make it, the value of an RPOW token is guaranteed by the value of the real-world resources required to \\'mint\\' a POW token.

Servers are intended to run on the IBM 4758 secure cryptographic coprocessor, which is able to securely verify the hash of the software that it is running. RPOW servers are capable of cooperating to serve more requests.\\n\\nRPOW white paper.\\n\\nThe best way to define how hashcash relate to Bitcoin is:\\n\\n*Hashcash is the tool use by Bitcoin to reach consensus.*\\n\\n**It is not a small achievement, it was a major breakthrough thought to be impossible...** \\n\\nEven Greg Maxwell said this problem cannot be solved.\\n\\n&gt;When bitcoin first came out, I was on the cryptography mailing list.

He cannot discuss it rationally.\\n\\n&gt;A couple of days ago, he criticized Back for not citing Dwork and Naor.\\n\\nI did write one comment I regret. I immediately copped to it unlike some others. At the [end of a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5kvb75/why_does_adam_back_keep_on_referring_to_bitcoin/dbrcbk0/), I wrote one sentence \"Back really should have cited their paper in his work.\" which I should not have wrote. As I said I copped to this mistake immediately. Back does cite Dwork and Naor in his 5 year follow up papers, and mentions them prominently at the beginning of the paper. He did not to my knowledge originally mention them at the conception of hashcash (I will take it on faith that he did not know about their work at the time, the intenet was not as good then).\\n\\nEdit: \"But he hates Adam Back and Greg Maxwell.\" Nope wrong again. I have absolutely nothing against Adam Back. I think hashcash PoW (not hashcash itself) was a key ingredient to the creation of bitcoin. When I\\'ve heard him speak he seems honest, rational, intelligent. My thoughts on Greg Maxwell are more complex. He is probably a brilliant cryptographer (I say probably because I am not one myself, so how would I know) and has contributed a ton to bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. His reddit persona though is, well a bit out there.', \"&gt; The Hashcash system has the advantage over micropayment proposals applying to legitimate email that no real money is involved. Neither the sender nor recipient need to pay, thus the administrative issues involved with all micropayment systems are entirely avoided.\\n\\nI take this to mean that no existing external form of money needed to be introduced as a form of payment precisely because Hashcash developed a way of getting one computer to *pay* semi-directly in labor. An analogy will suffice:\\n\\nImagine an elder care facility devised a way of paying homeless people for doing work for them without requiring payment in fiat currency. In this system, the homeless person could do some work for one of the facility's patients -- say give a massage to one of elderly people housed there -- and in turn the patient would write the homeless worker a note, indicating they had, in fact, successfully performed some work on their behalf. The homeless person could then take this note up to the front desk, upon receipt the desk would reward them with a nice warm meal. \\n\\nSoon the facility would realize that these notes could be faked, so they needed some standardized note that wasn't easily forged. They also used a record of their patients signatures to help verify authenticity. When they received a signed note, they shredded it. \\n\\nIn this system, the elder care facility's special note is functioning as a very primitive currency. The fact that the currency cannot be traded is a limitation to it ever being used beyond its current use case, but it doesn't change the fact that the note is being used to indicate value -- indicate how much work had been done -- store that value in time, and can be exchanged for a hot meal.  \\n\\nI'm not interested in trying to prove or disprove that Bitcoin is just hashcash with inflation control. I don't personally see how that is a defensible statement for many of the reasons you gave. Nor am I interested in defending Adam Back. Those are your issues, apparently. My issue is simply with this idea that Hashcash has nothing to do with currency, when clearly that's not true. \\n\\n\\n\", \"I agree I couldn't possibly claim that Marx was solely responsible for this. But I can point to the paragraphs where he argues strongly in favour of both of these ideas. Most people would happily accept that both of the ideas above are socialist in their essence - you might want to try and distinguish socialism and marxism, but I think its fair to say that most socialists regard Marx as a key influence on their thinking. To divide countries up as 'capitalist' or 'socialist' is quite arbitrary anyway. I think education of the poor was originally handled by churches and those who weren't 'lucky' went straight to the factories anyway.

Arresting any of the developers would also accomplish nothing as it would be a wack-a-mole adventure where it would embolden others to keep trying to expand the protocol and such acts would actually spread the range of those who know about it.  Experience with the deCSS software is something that didn't go unnoticed by federal prosecutors.\\n\\nSomething you are also missing in your analysis is that financial transactions already are heavily monitored, and indeed I would dare say much easier to trace than what is done via Bitcoin where plausible deniability is ever present.... particularly as you can't be traced if you don't spend Bitcoins unlike what happens with conventional banking transactions.\\n\\nYes, the folks at the NSA could have invented something like Bitcoin because they certainly have a bunch of very competent software devlopers working for the organization.  Ditto for Google or Microsoft.... both of which have smarter and better software developers as well as many more than those working for the NSA (in my own estimation).  I would also dare say that among the body of people who are independent developers, there are people who as a group number far more than any specific organization you can point to and are much smarter than any gaggle of PhDs you can find (a PhD in computer science doesn't mean much in terms of software development skill) and some utterly brilliant people can and do come up with some really interesting stuff.\\n\\nYou are simply presuming that brilliant ideas must come from some sort of organized activity when in fact historically that generally is not the case.

Since, in PoS Ethereum, new coins are being generated at no cost, the number of coins (i.e., the supply) increases, but the sum total value of those coins does not (i.e., the market cap). If the total number of coins in Ethereum were 100, and the price of each ether were $1, then the total market cap would be $100. If you then increased the supply by 10 ether, where each new ether costs $0 (as opposed to $1 as they should), the new supply of ether would be 110, but the market cap would still remain at $100 ($100 + 10($0)), causing the actual value of each ether to be ~$0.91 ($100/110). By depreciating the value of ether, the system is redistributing wealth to the stake holders in order to pay them to mine. That\\'s what I mean by it is using inflation, it is taxing the majority to pay the miners.\\n\\nCompare that to Bitcoin: Let\\'s say the total number of bitcoins were 100, and each bitcoin cost $1. The market cap would = $100. Now, say that 10 additional bitcoins were created. The costs of these bitcoins is roughly $1 since in Bitcoin it costs about that much in real life resources to mint new bitcoins. Now the total supply of bitcoins is 110, and the market cap is $100 + $10(1) = $110, meaning that bitcoins experience no inflation, their value remains at $1 per bitcoin. So the miners are not taking value from the larger community of bitcoin holders.\\n\\nThe problem is that when people talk about inflation in this space, they tend to simply mean the supply of coins increasing. But an increase in the supply of coins is just that, an increase in the supply of coins. Inflation means the depreciation of the purchasing power of the coin. If new coins are minted in such a way that the market cap remains unchanged, then no inflation occurs. So it isn\\'t really fair to say that Bitcoin uses inflation to pay for PoW the way Ethereum does. \\n ', '&gt;&amp;gt; You are describing the way paper got \"implemented\" to become a currency.\\n\\n&gt;In my way of thinking, the moment of money, in the banking sense, was the moment a piece of paper could be used to represent something of value and exchanged for that something. \\n\\nThe difference is hashcash doesn\\'t represent something of value it represents a cost you are willing to waste to access the service.\\n\\nA challenge you are willing to pass (burning the $500)\\n\\nThe service you are gaining access using POW is not getting anything of value that it can further exchange therefore it is not a transaction.\\n\\nYou pay it by wasting resources it doesn\\'t mean a financial transactions happened because the recipient never got any currency of value it can exchange again.\\n\\nYou have been given a challenge to pass to be granted a service, it is very different from being asked to exchange an item of value to access a service.\\n\\n&gt;All the rest were just improvements. Your definition seems to entail the ability to exchange that piece of paper with more than one entity, I don\\'t see why that is a requirement. \\n\\nWithout that properties what you are sending is not a medium of exchange, it is simply something different.\\n\\nA proof of challenge, a proof of burnt energy.\\n\\nIt is very different than a currency, you would agree?\\n\\n&gt;If energy expenditure were simply being done, I would agree. But that is not what is happening, the energy expenditure is being *used* to purchase services from the server. You are saying that energy expenditure has no intrinsic value. But that is true of everything. Gold has no intrinsic value, \\n\\nPOW has no intrinsic value because once energy has been burnt it is gone and cannot be used again therefore it cannot hold any value.\\n\\nWhat you are doing is respond to a challenge, not paying to access a service.\\n\\nThis precisely what Hal Finney tried to do with RPOW to make it a currency, by exchanging spend POW by a fresh one, making was possible to use POW hashes as a medium of exchange.\\n\\n&gt;but once people realized it could be used to create jewelry it acquired value. Same with burning energy in the case. In itself it has no value, but once people realized it could be used to prevent spam it acquired value. \\n\\nHashcash POW hashes never value.\\n\\nRPOW might have, I am not even sure this project ever been tested..\\n\\n&gt;&amp;gt; Well in Bitcoin we basically use inflation to pay for the POW\\n\\n&gt;If PoW is just proof of burnt energy and has no economic value, why would you pay for it? I\\'m just giving you a hard time. \\n\\nBecause the way POW is used is to allow the network to know what is the valid chain.\\n\\nThe longest chain (the one whith the most POW) is the valid one.\\n\\nNow that the whole network can find consensus on a set of rules and on transactions history, Bitcoin can retain value and be used as a medium of exchange *(the future will tell us if it can be a reliable store of value)*\\n\\nThis is an immense breakthrough, I struggle to understand why Adam Black put such a strong emphasis on some (weak) pseudo-currency properties of hashcash when it could emphasize that hashcash help Bitcoin solve the bizantine general paradox.\\n\\nFor years it was thought to be impossible.\\n\\n&gt;By depreciating the value of ether, the system is redistributing wealth to the stake holders in order to pay them to mine. That\\'s what I mean by it is using inflation, it is taxing the majority to pay the miners.\\n\\nThis is exactly how Bitcoin pay for its POW by debasing the currency (block reward = inflation)\\n\\n&gt;Compare that to Bitcoin: Let\\'s say the total number of bitcoins were 100, and each bitcoin cost $1. The market cap would = $100. Now, say that 10 additional bitcoins were created. The costs of these bitcoins is roughly $1 since in Bitcoin it costs about that much in real life resources to mint new bitcoins. Now the total supply of bitcoins is 110, and the market cap is $100 + $10(1) = $110, meaning that bitcoins experience no inflation, their value remains at $1 per bitcoin. So the miners are not taking value from the larger community of bitcoin holders.\\n\\nCost doesn\\'t equal to value.\\n\\nIf it cost 1$ to mined the equivalent of one Bitcoin, then miner will have to spend 1$ of FIAT value to create it.\\n\\nThey will have then to sell 1$ worth of Bitcoin for it. This creates selling pressure.\\n\\nPOW is not free, it has to be paid for.\\n\\nMost of the miner run on very tight margins, meaning most of the block reward create selling pressure. Inflation happens, if price increases it is just because demand go beyond the current inflation.\\n\\n&gt;The problem is that when people talk about inflation in this space, they tend to simply mean the supply of coins increasing. But an increase in the supply of coins is just that, an increase in the supply of coins. Inflation means the depreciation of the purchasing power of the coin. If new coins are minted in such a way that the market cap remains unchanged, then no inflation occurs. \\n\\nIt is impossible unless POW cost nothing.\\n\\nPOW have a cost by definition.\\n\\n&gt;So it isn\\'t really fair to say that Bitcoin uses inflation to pay for PoW the way Ethereum does. \\n \\nIt is.\\n\\nThere only two way to pay for the POW by block reward (inflation) or transactions fees (usage).\\n\\nNow Bitcoin overwhelmingly use inflation to pay for its POW and gradually switch slow to transactions.\\n\\nOnly when Bitcoin will have no more block reward than it will be inflation free.', '&gt; If it cost 1$ to mined the equivalent of one Bitcoin, then miner will have to spend 1$ of FIAT value to create it.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \\n&gt; \\n&gt; They will have then to sell 1$ worth of Bitcoin for it.

Inflation happens, if price increases it is just because demand go beyond the current inflation.\\n\\nIf a miner spends $100 to mine 0.1 bitcoin, how is that different than if someone goes to an exchange and spends $100 to buy 0.1 bitcoin? Are you suggesting that a person who buys bitcoin at the exchange is increasing selling pressure?', \"Because in the first case you add 0.1BTC to the total supply, in the second you don't.\\n\\nEdit: if all miner hold to their block reward and don't sell forever, there would be no inflation, indeed.\", \"&gt; Edit: if all miner hold to their block reward and don't sell forever, there would be no inflation, indeed\\n\\n*Exactly.* This is a very important point. \\n\\nThe market price is not based on the number of coins in existence, it is based on the number of people selling vs. the number of people buying. \\n\\nThe real price of a coin, on the other hand, is based on the market cap divided by the supply. \\n\\nNow a thought experiment: Imagine a digital currency that didn't involve mining and instead allowed people to directly purchase newly minted coins on a regular basis. Suppose the premium for these newly minted coins was 100%. Do you think this would create selling pressure? Do you think people who bought these coins would immediately sell them at a loss?\\n\\nLikewise, imagine the same scenario, but instead the newly minted coins were sold at a fraction of the market price, say 75% off. Is it not obvious that if you could make an immediate huge gain by reselling these coins immediately, you would do so? if the newly minted coins were sold at below their market value, this would create tremendous selling pressure, causing inflation. \\n\\nIn other words, the higher the costs of mining relative to the market price, the lower the selling pressure that entails. \\n\\nFurthermore, imagine the Ethereum situation where the new coins are free. While the issuance of these new coins would have no immediate effect on the market price of ether, the real price of ether (market cap divided by supply) would decline for the reasons I gave in my previous post. Consequently, you would know that the market price was more expensive than the real price. This would give you huge incentive to sell *immediately* in order to capture this spread before the market price can fall in line with the real price. If you failed to act, your competition would certainly take advantage of your laziness, and cause the price to decline until it was inline with the real price. Knowing this tendency, the competition to sell quickly newly minted coins would increase, and cause the readjustment of the market price falling in line with the real price to only accelerate. \\n\\nTake Bitcoin instead. If the miner spends roughly $1000 in to mine a newly minted bitcoin and the market price is $900, why should he sell at a loss? Furthermore, assuming all miners spent roughly the same amount to mine their current bitcoin, and the market price is below these costs, they also know that the *real* price of bitcoin is actually above the market price, because despite the increase in supply, the value of the newly minted coins is higher than market, so the real price (market cap divided by supply) has actually gone up. This further incentivizes them to hodl.  \\n\\nYou see, it isn't *just* about the supply of coins. For inflation to occur, these newly created coins must be sold, and there is tremendous pressure not to sell at a loss. In Ethereum, this never occurs, because the newly issued coins are free, so you can never sell at a loss, meaning the newly issued coins *always* create selling pressure. But that isn't true in Bitcoin.   \", '&gt; Take Bitcoin instead. If the miner spends roughly $1000 in to mine a newly minted bitcoin and the market price is $900, why should he sell at a loss?\\n\\nWell because you have a $1000 energy bill to pay.', \"I imagine miners who have to constantly sell in order to keep their head above water wouldn't survive a bear market.

You do not even necessarily contact the pool operators at all.\\n\\nIf you switch to the scheme I have outlined, the hash-power should get allocated as follows:\\n\\n* 50% of the hash power will be allocated to A-Blocks, and 50% to B-Blocks. This is because the reward on each phase is equal, so if it is noticed that the difficulty on one phase is lower than another, more hash power will be moved there.\\n\\n* 100% of the B-Block hash power will be large solo-miners. Only large miners can tolerate the variance, and the work cannot be outsourced to un-trustable (that is to say, un-punishable) entities.\\n\\n* 80% of the A-Block hash power will be pools, 20% will be large solo miners.\\n\\nI would argue that this is a superior situation. By rounding up all of the small miners and focusing their power on only half of the blocks, you put them in greater control of those blocks. Forcing these little guys to censor transactions is much more difficult, so it is likely that otherwise censored transactions will be mined by them. In fact, the continued existence and relevance of these little fish is a deterrent to attempting censorship in the first place.', '\"Transactions are keyed to phases\" means that when I create a transaction, I must select which phase may validly mine the transaction.\\n\\nLet\\'s say you are an A-miner, and an A-block is mined. Now what do you do? Do you power down your hardware until a valid B-block is mined? Once a valid B-block is mined, you must validate it before you can start mining, which puts you at a disadvantage, especially if the block interval is only 5 minutes.\\n\\nIt would be great if you could just start mining the next A-block immediately. You could mine an empty A-block immediately, because you have the previous A-block header, and the B-block header immediately before it... However, you do not know which transactions are about to be included in the B-block currently under construction. If you duplicate their work, you will not be paid for it.\\n\\nThis last problem goes away if roughly half of the mem-pool cannot be mined by B-miner. You stay away from those transactions and you are probably pretty safe.\\n\\nAs for big miners rendering their previous investment void -- I don\\'t think that is any problem. Mining equipment is obsolete very quickly. Just give everyone enough runway and a gradual cut-over and it will be fine.\\n\\nThe much bigger (insurmountable?) problem would be getting consensus on a hard fork, but I have a suspicion that a change like this could be done with a clever soft fork, since apparently almost anything can.\\n\\n', 'So \"key\" doesn\\'t mean any cryptography trick, but basically \"flag\", right?\\n\\nSoftforks can be done only when consensus rules are strengthened, not loosed or changed. For example, consider a rule saying some field must be an integer less than 10. Now if the new rule says the field must be an integer less than 5, it can be done via a softfork; if the new rule says the field must be an integer less than 20 or it must be a floating point number of some sort, it can be done only via a hardfork.', '&gt;So \"key\" doesn\\'t mean any cryptography trick, but basically \"flag\", right?\\n\\nRight', 'In this scenario, the handful of solo miners could 51% the smaller chain with some of the hashpower, and then since they are already controlled and only solo miners can mine the big chain, they will fully control the big chain as well.\\n\\nBest I can tell this setup makes attacks easier.', '&gt;In this scenario, the handful of solo miners could 51% the smaller chain with some of the hashpower\\n\\nThey cannot do this, because they only control 20% of the hash power for POW-A.\\n\\n(The two phases have a different POW.)', \"Electricity tends to be more expensive than hardware, not to difficult to imagine miners having hardware sets for each pow so that they can switch between them as profitable. Not as true currently because of the crazy R&amp;D happening, but I think that will eventually settle down.\\n\\nBut also, the solo miners I imagine would end up owning more than 20% of the pool PoW because they will be more competitve. The solo PoW is exclusive which means less competition, which means you don't need to devote as many resources to be competitive. \", \"I don't have a knock down argument against that, and of course adversarial design means that any plan should be thought all the way through and air tight. It makes an interesting thought experiment.\\n\\nHere are a couple of things to consider:\\n\\nThe idea that B-Block miners will not be in a competitive situation and will have extra money to launch expensive and unprofitable attacks on the network strikes me as implausible. We have seen that mining is an insanely competitive industry. The dynamics of difficulty adjustment will, I would assert, assure that there will be only small profits for the top tier B-Block miners, and losses for the bottom performers.\\n\\nThe idea that solo miners will, therefore, have on hand some huge pile of ASICs, with leased rack space, just to occasionally and unprofitably divert their electrical power and attack the A-Miners seems implausible.\\n\\nWhen would they launch this attack? When they magically sense that A-Miners are working on a disfavored block? Trying to orphan an already mined disfavored block?\\n\\nBear in mind that if the solo miners divert their electricity to their latent A-Mining capacity, they must either switch off their B-Mining equipment, or have huge latent electrical power capacity. The scale of large solo mining operations may make having all of that optional electrical power expensive as well. This is not like plugging in your vacuum cleaner; these large mining operations might need to contract with power plants ahead of time or they can create local brown outs or have their service deactivated. For miners parked near remote hydroelectric or solar installations, extra capacity may simply not physically exist.\\n\\nFurthermore, the scenario where solo miners have all of those A-block ASICs, and spare capacity, and can have them on all the time, etc, ... well that is simply not the scenario I am pondering. In that scenario, the solo miners have 100% of the hashpower pointed at B-blocks, and 50%+ of the hash power pointed at A-blocks. With 75% of the total network hashpower, of course it is game over in this game design, as it would be in the current Bitcoin design.\\n\\nIf, rather than have spare capacity, the attacking B-miners divert power from solving the B-block, they give B-miners who are not participating in the censorship initiative a grace period to mine with less competition, and possibly include undesired transactions that way, creating a kind of whack-a-mole situation. \\n\\nLast thing, it may not be very efficient to try to instantly power up ASICs and start hashing, compared with ASICs which hash continuously without being powered down. \"], 'month': ['2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01', '2017-01'], 'user': ['ugtarmas', 'moral_agent', 'Taek42', 'exab', 'moral_agent', 'moral_agent', 'exab', 'moral_agent', 'Taek42', 'moral_agent', 'Taek42', 'moral_agent']}\n",

My use case would be that I store my master pass on my usb device that I keep with me at all times like my keys/wallet/cell.  If i'm browsing anything that security is a priority, I have to have my hardware token and have a challenge PIN to unlock it.  Since I'd be making it myself (I have decent skills to make something that shows up as a USB device and could be used to input the stored password), the person would REALLY have to come after ME to figure out my implementation of the scheme.\\n\\nIf you dont mind me asking, what part of security (domain[network,application]/industry[finance/healthcare]) do you work in?

I want to portray OTP in a positive light, so telling someone to input the pre-shared key sounds intimidating. Much easier to say \"hold up your phone, the app takes a pic, and the QR code contains everything needed to set it up.\"\\n\\nI use 1Password. Tried LastPass a while ago and decided to go with 1Password for no particular reason. Prior to that I used Keeper, which I purposefully ditched.

How does Jimmy know for certain that Billy's check won't bounce? That is, before trying to deposit?\\n\\nWhat if Billy staples to his check to Jimmy, the previous check, uncashed, that Billy got from Amanda for $75 (And consequently, Billy also writes a check for $25 to himself with the same conditions).\\n\\nSo how do you make sure Amanda's check doesn't bounce? Same rules apply, staple an old check to Amanda's check. And you repeat this thought process over and over until you reach the Mint.\\n\\nOf course, at some point the binder of checks becomes too big to realistically carry or verify. But what if the whole process was digital? You still have the same security, but without all the dead trees. Enter Bitcoin's Blockchain tech.\\n\\nSee, most banks treat your balance as a transaction sheet as a generic in and generic out, not Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, I'm not just sending you some generic amount of 5 mBTC, I'm sending you, specifically, the 2.5 mBTC I got as change from the coffee shop down the road, plus the 1.5 mBTC that I got as a tip on my Twitch stream using Coinstream,  plus the 1 mBTC that's leftover from the last time I converted from fiat on LocalBitcoins.\\n\\nI feel like it's sloppy, and could be refined, but that's what I got.\\n\\n15fP1gv31EBSjDQnK6AEUCf7Rc8VxzSNbh\", 'Passing out the public address of their wallet really has few significant downsides.  I can think of 2:\\n\\n1)  Because those wallets are part of the public record in the block chain, everyone knows how much money is in each.  Then if they know who owns a given wallet, they know how much money he has.\\n\\n2)  A person might not want people to know where they spend their money and on what.  Again, tying a wallet to that person ties the transactions to that person.\\n\\nBut theft is not a problem.  Any wallet has a public address and a private address.  Think of them as one-way doors.  BTC can pass through the public address into a wallet but cannot pass out through that address.  The private address is the reverse, that BTC can pass out through it and not in.\\n\\nIf you know the private address of a wallet, it is not hard to calculate the public address.  The reverse is not true, however.  Given the public address, there is no known way more efficient than brute force (guessing more times than there are atoms in the known universe) to determine its corresponding private address.\\n\\nSo you can put a public bitcoin address on a billboard, in a magazine ad, or on TV without risk of losing those funds.', \"Gotcha. Thanks for the info. So if you want to be private you don't want to give it out. Especially if you're trying to stay under the radar. \", \"Right.  But many bitcoin software packages will manage multiple wallets simultaneously, virtually invisible to the user.  If a person wanted to receive payments without linking their identity to a given wallet, they could simply create a new wallet through which to receive the new payment.\\n\\nAdditional steps might need to be taken to stop a person associating that new wallet with other wallets the person owns, depending on how private they wanted / needed to be.

I\\'m still a fresh learner everyday. \\n\\nHowever, I asked a question to me \"What should I need from fiatleak if I\\'m a user, developer, investor, trader, firm?\" and interpreted myself to come with some points.\\n\\nThis is a very short list. I need to say something more if I get enough help.\\n\\nExcuse me, if I have written something you already have, or suggestions from people posted above and below. \\n\\nI might add/edit the post if I strike a new point or express a listed point in more clear way. \\n\\nI don\\'t know if my points are worth to read and reward according to your brainstorming needs. However, I expressed myself.\\n\\nFinally I wish a great prosperous new year wishes. Thanks. Moving into discussions now :\\n\\n**Basic information**\\n\\nWhat should you know? Explain to just a user, a developer, an investor, a company, alien levels.\\n\\n**Wiki**\\n\\nWiki must include basic information about bitcoin. History of bitcoin, recent developments, criticisms, controversies and different testing implementations and the adapted techniques one by one. You can easily link to existing wiki. However, a fiatleak wiki in a much approached way to target the visitor can attract more people and works well overtime. \\n\\nYou need to update it often as things are changing rapidly. You can also host debates,AMAs and ask people to post their questions, suggestions. You can also try to answer the questions. This will get you return visitors. \\n\\n**Honor your visitors**\\n\\nIllustrations, Wiki are not quite enough. After every page/topic/tutorial/video/illustration/visual/debate/AMA/etc., you can host a quiz and reward people.\\n\\nYou can reward users in different means :\\n\\n* Award currency - bitcoin, any altcoin, Fiatleak altcoin (if you wish to create).\\n\\n* Badges - Award bitcoin badges who pass quizzes. As you know, you can fix the level a beginner/expert/developer/pro. You can also let him/her link a fiatleak badge to his/her blog or affix in his/her firm.\\n\\n* Certification - You can turn into a training institute and start certifying people by treating your quizzes are real tests. You can also earn great reputation in the marketplace. If you\\'re intended to so, this will be a lot of work for you and you need to include programming resources for bitcoin.\\n\\n* From time to time and on special days/occasions you can host mega contests, get sponsors and award visitors. It can get your site keep visited. I don\\'t intend it for marketing and your growth. You need to do it wisely by not making people mistakenly think about a lottery site. You can award Hardware wallets, Desktops/Laptops, Mining hashes, Free courses, tickets to next to happen tech thans/stalls/etc., \\n\\n[Note: You can also get sponsors for quizzes. Let them award people]\\n\\n**Physical bitcoins** - What is it? Who is making? Can you make one? How it can be traded? + information\\n\\n**Plus** \\n\\n* Videos, pdfs, handouts, Memes, cartoons will help new people who learn things differently.\\n\\n* Ask visitors **\"Can you live with bitcoin?\"** Then take them to virtual home/office/marketplace and visually illustrate how can they live with bitcoin. Let them visually and virtually (really also) make purchases, spendings, book orders, reserve suits, lease, start a firm, pay employees, tip people, pay taxes and else in bitcoin. \\n\\n* This includes selling for bitcoin, spending for bitcoin, working for bitcoin and many more. You need to brainstorm for a lot of time to get a clear script of what you\\'re going to say here. \\n\\n* Virtual tour helps people realize bitcoin usage and a vital addition to fiatleak.\\n\\n[Note : Source real offers from merchants and let people use in realtime inside visuals. You can also let people use coupons. A great marketplace ahead. Brainstorming will unveil more. I will put a ... here]\\n\\n* You can try to get great artworks, animations+sounds to show the walk of the life. While illustrating these things, you can include references to live websites, merchants and other setups to make the visitor feel the reality. \\n\\n[Note: You can also charge PPM, PPC from them as you\\'re practically advertising while visually preparing newcomers to adapt to bitcoin.]\\n\\n* You can also ask the people/visitor to post their own views/artworks/visuals/illustrations/blogs that leads to basic understanding, usage and implications of bitcoin at various levels. \\n\\n[Note : An SEO healthy link from their own blogs can get you load of visitors daily and make fiatleak one of the imminent website to source information about bitcoin. Long way to go]\\n\\n\\n**Fiatleak Platform**\\n\\n**[The fiatleak website/platform must be view complaint on all platforms existing.

Include price charts similar to trendingview and let people to work on it if they wish to find out trading stuff. This would turn fiatleak into a great platform.\\n\\n**Calculators/Estimators**\\n\\nInclude calculators. This will help viewers to estimate their profit/loss or make decisions about their next moves. These calculators must also include mining, trading, lending, forex calcs if needed.\\n\\nPublic spending price alerts [I think some users may have suggested it.]\\n\\nA robust update 24x7 in a page/link that helps users to know about bitcoin support providers in terms of :\\n\\n&gt;Payment Gateways\\n\\n&gt;Websites\\n\\n&gt;Merchants\\n\\n&gt;ATMs\\n\\n&gt;Debitcards\\n\\n&gt;Developers\\n\\n&gt;Startups\\n\\n&gt;Freenlance Reources\\n\\n&gt;etc.,\\n\\n[Note : I wish to have a detailed customizable list based on countrywise, statewise, popularity, Newly included and many other criteria]\\n\\n**Regulatory/Banking rules for all countries**\\n\\nPrepare a great list of information about laws and regulations in each country and add it to fiatleak.

You can turn into a great law, taxmen board to interact with their country men to deal bitcoins. This will help people who startup a crypto firm, project or wish to do business.\\n\\nMake it customizable.\\n\\nHost AMAs, run request campaign for regulators if people need it. Lot can be done. Brainstorm helps.]\\n\\n\\n**Customizable Richlists**\\n\\nLet the user set his/her own criteria. Countrywise richlist of bitcoin holders on a particular year, date, month. Currency wise richlist of bitcoin holders + some other criteria. etc., etc., and etc., \\n\\n\\n**Fiatleak API**\\n\\nHelp visitors get use of fiatleak platform and other stuff programmatically by creating compelling API that supports integration a variety of levels. This includes simply linking to their blogs/websites, business analytics. \\n\\nHelp online tutors and presenters to quote live information from fiatleak. \\n\\nCreate other stuff that can show dynamic live information.\\n\\n**Fiatleak Forum** - Create a fiatleak forum that helps users interact.\\n\\n**Blockexplorer** - Create most advanced blockexplorer and include information that most others don\\'t have.\\n\\n**A live chat** - A live chat window can help people seek support and contact with the administrators instantly.\\n\\n**Support** Let people to reach you at any time.

I hope this will offer enough directions for fiatleak. This is not the end. This is just the beginning. At least, one point or a part of a point may give you hint(s). I will try to add more points in time.\\n\\nThanks for reading. Good luck.\\n\\n[Note : My bitcoin address if you think eligible for reward : 18byECEze4nLwyaMgwPjFP3V6ZVYFok6qP]\\n\\n', 'Wow!  Can you include your bitcoin address?  ', 'Yes! I will include it.\\n\\nEdit : Included.', 'I just sent 200 mBTC in rewards, thanks guys!', 'Got 50 mBTC. Thanks. Good luck to your venture.

You website is not that good enough.\\n\\nI give a score of only 40 out of 100. Here I will say why? Read all. If you read and comment back on these lines, I would be glad that I did really help a real guy.  \\n\\nYou need SSL Certification\\nPeople may find a link route to intrude into exchange sites from where you seek trades. Leads to vulnerabilities.\\n\\nThe design is completely awkward for me. Redesign it.\\n\\nSelect a perfect theme. The social media buttons are located in the places where people won\\'t go for a share.\\n\\n\\nThere are three charts \"Last 24 hours BTC/USD price\". But all three are same. It seems the website is in works.\\nWhen I click \"Last 24 hours BTC/USD price\" It is not taking me to bitcoinity.org. Why? Fix it as quick as you can.\\n\\nThe language option button must be place to the top right of the webpage. It is in the wrong place. I first thought it will redefine the chart to a particular language speaking people and show only btc transactions happening there. Change it.\\n\\n\\n\"Why are you waiting for first trade to occur?\" I think unfare for the reason you run this site. Transactions happening round the clock. So change it. Show transactions of all time. Also the wait period for first trade takes around 5 minutes to start. People will leave your site if it is the case. Here you can go for options - All time trade, New trades. This will help.\\n\\nFatal error :\\n\\nWhen I refresh the page, the page again looks for first trade. This should be fixed. It should not be so. Again go for new trades/all time trades.\\n\\nYour twitter feeds must be shown on the right side. This is very handy for people to read. Left side attracts less.\\nThe social media icons on the botton of the page is very small and will not be visible to many people. It sucks.\\n\\nThe exchanges you listed to the bottom of the page \"Data from ...\" is completely not visible. You don\\'t need to gray it. You should be proud to list it. Increase the size. It is very small. This applies to next line also. Also ask people to suggest sites and currencies to add. \\n\\nIf it is opensource developement, then where do you host or update your code. Include github or other similar site where you host your code. That will please people.\\n\\nThe advertisement placements are ok. But it is not visible or don\\'t get you clicks. You need to work on it.\\n\\nWhen I click one of the news links, it takes me to a new page and then redirects to the website where the content page is located.\\n\\nBut when it takes to the next page, I see the fiatleak redirect link with some random hash. Instead, you can modify the redirect link with actual news information. If you know wordpress, you can know how can you change this. It is one of the important thing every blog creater uses.\\n\\nAlternately, you can create a blog.fiatleak subdomain. Curate news content to your blog. Show the startup lines and add \"Read more...\" button and when people click \"Read more...\" redirect them to the concernced website. \\n\\nWhen I click on the exchanges you list, it opens the exchange site on the same tab. Instead code it to open a new tab. \\nYou have included these exchanges in your calculations. BITSTAMP, BTCChina, BTC-E, Bit2c, Mercado Bitcoin BR, Local Bitcoins, OKCoin, BTCTrade, Huobi China, bitx.co.za, Cavirtex, Bitfinex, Gemini.\\n\\nI thought when clicking one of the sites, you will be redefining the animations particular to that exchange only. Misleading.\\n\\nThere are lot of excellent themes available on the internet. One of the best one is bootstrap which I admire a lot. Create your website using any of the themes. You first need to try different themes. You can conduct a poll from your supporters to select a good theme. \\n\\nI think you\\'re the only one who takes care of back and front end. That\\'s why the designs are not appealing. I don\\'t think this website loads well in mobile phones.\\n\\nDid you check the loading time of the website? Did you check with different browsers? Do you have the analysis? How much you\\'re comfortable with CSS? \\n\\nI think you\\'re using apis of concerned websites to fetch data and do your math. Do you know the api limits of these sites? You need to catch exceptions wherever possible. I think if 100s of viewers online, you may see delays in fetching and displaying. Look into it.\\n\\n\\nWhy you need \"Hide animations?\" button. I don\\'t see a need of this website, if you hide animations. The worst thing is the moment you tick \"Hide animations\" the incoming trades are not shown. I check 2 to 3 times. No trades coming in after I click it. But it is working. It seems you need to \"QC\" with different use cases. Also you need to check for the 1m trade volume. It seems not calculating correctly. Or the animations are not understandable by all.\\n\\nIf you turn off the animation, then you need to add more text to textually visualize the btc-currency pair transaction. Example \"USD to BTC\" \"BTC to CNY\" for every trade that happens. You need also add these to the leftside textbox which displays every trade you track.\\n\\nWhy you need this website? How can it help the new comer to bitcoin? How can people know about fiatleak? Who will introduce fiatleak to new comers? and many questions you need to answer yourself.\\n\\nThere is no coinmarketcap information in any place. \\n\\nYou need to add options to show/hide sections of the page. User must be able to show/hide twitter feeds, leftside trade display box. News section, that bitcoinity.org chart section. Why the chart is not updating?\\n\\nBesides, you can include lot of information. This is a very simple one. If you target Adsense you need to work a lot on keywords and techniques to make it search friendly.\\n\\nHow many times in a week, you analyze your traffic? That is needed.\\n\\nI did a small analysis on the technologies you use in building the website. I have seen nginx and some other good stuff there. But you need a lot of improvement. You have excellent set of tools to help you there. But you\\'re delaying.\\n\\nSome other tips\\n\\n1. Don\\'t use iframes. It is not used in these modern days. Not worth to use it.\\n\\n2. fiatleak.com -watch... heading tag must be smarter than that is now and should be shorter than 80 characters.\\n\\n3. Meta description should also be rephrased to be smart and simple and easy to understand.\\n\\n4. Add alt tags to images you include.\\n\\n5. No social share so far. Don\\'t you even share it in your site. Or my analytics didn\\'t show much.\\n\\n6. You have very few backlinks. Try to increase it.\\n\\n7. Keyword usage is very low.\\n\\n8. You need to add more content pages for your site. There is 0 or no content page available right now for your site. If you add content pages, you can get more keywords and get listed in search engines faster.\\n\\n9. Page level speed is very poor. You\\'re making as hard as 81 requests to show this page. Work on it. This is not helpful in the long time. You can use bitcoinwisdom.com like sites to fetch trade information by one request instead of sending request to all exchanges.\\nAlternately, you can make a local database that collects data from all exchanges and use a single query to fetch from there. This increases speed to a great level. \\n\\n10. You must be aware of loading javascript at the bottom of the page to speed up the page load.\\n\\n11. I think you have CSS in a stylesheet. Good. But still you need to work on. Use Minfication techniques if not done.\\n\\n12. Try to use gzip, Etags. Session cache also helps to retain the animations when people refresh the page.\\n\\nOkay.

Hardware doesn't become secure by magic, there is a trust relation involved.\\n\\nIf you ignore this, you are ignoring the most important weakness of your idea and it will fail.\", \"&gt; At that point, the absolute trust in a central authority is merely bluster.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter which hardware solution you choose, you have to find one that both parties trust or else you can't setup a channel.\\n\\nYou may both choose to trust Apple, or Intel, or el33th4xor's own company. How does that make that absolute trust any less of an issue?\\n\\nYou currently can choose which bank you put your account in, and you end up ultimately trusting that bank (although with banks there actually are laws in place). Just because there are more banks to choose from has not stopped the US government being able to lock up any funds any bank holds anywhere.\\n\\nThis trust in a central party is *exactly* what Bitcoin replaces. And TeeChan does its work by bringing it back.\\n\\nIts a nice idea, but can't possibly be used on a grand scale because of the inherent risks it has.\", \"&gt; You may both choose to trust Apple, or Intel, or el33th4xor's own company. How does that make that absolute trust any less of an issue?\\n\\nThis is getting absurd. Now that you've thrown in *el33th4xor's own company* I am sure you realise his HW could very well be OSHW, so in your own convoluted logic, would that remove the absolute trust conundrum?\\n\\nI think you've got this completely out of context. If even the HW manufacturer can not compromise the data sharing between the enclaves, then how on earth could they be a central party in whom absolute trust is required that may be different to their cpu's processing transactions? And of-course the proof of concept works with only similar HW, but who's to say a common instruction set will not emerge if usage for this kind of tech grows (and my thinking is this is how it'll get to mobile platforms)?\", \"&gt; This is incorrect: none of the data Teechan sends is encrypted by keys supplied by Intel.  remote attestation does not result in keys; it yields a proof of platform,\\n\\nYou didn't understand what I wrote then. You refuted a point I didn't make.\\n\\nRemote attestation can only happen by the hardware having a shared secret which is typically done by having keys.\\n\\n&gt; So it is entirely possible for an SGX Teechan to talk to a Trezor Teechan. \\n\\nThis is false because your trezor could not possibly validate the correctness of both the hardware the other is running on as well as the software it is running.\\n\\nThis is extremely basic cryptography and concepts of trust.\", '[deleted]', \"I completely agree with you that this is a real and big problem. LN doesn't solve routing, I don't see TeeChan coming any closer to this.\\n\\nMy point was merely that even if routing was done and possible, its main design of trust means you **still** can't have mixed hardware in that structure. And I think that is an even more basic flaw because even if you can route 100 nodes, do you really want that if they all have to use the exact same hardware vendor and the exact same software vendor and version ?\", \"&gt;And I think that is an even more basic flaw because even if you can route 100 nodes, do you really want that if they all have to use the exact same hardware vendor and the exact same software vendor and version ?\\n\\n\\nI don't believe it would be a requirement for the hardware vendor to be the same, just the hardware architecture.  Similarly, the software wouldn't have to be the same code, just compatible.  However, the hardware has to be mutually trusted.  Alice has to trust her own TEE hardware vendor.  She also has to trust Bob's TEE hardware vendor.  They would not necessarily have to be the same vendor, but Alice would have to trust both vendors in that case.  Similarly, the source code that runs in the TEE doesn't have to be identical or come from the same vendor.  It could be open source.  Indeed, the two execution environments wouldn't even have to use the same hardware architecture if Alice could trust the software/hardware execution on both machines as being functionally equivalent.  (Bob's view of the channel to Alice and his trust requirements are symmetrical.)  Obviously, the simplest way to make sure that the two trusted state machines work together is to make them identical in implementation, but this is not a requirement of the architecture.\\n\\nThis disposed of the trivial case of a two node network.  To scale up to a 100 node network, as you suggest, requires some form of transitive trust, or a totally centralized model.  To keep this discussion simple, I'm going to discuss the simplest non-trivial network, which has three nodes connected in a line:  \\n\\nA - B - C\\n\\nIt is implemented by two channels  \\n\\n A  (A,B) B (B,C) C\\n\\nThe paper did not discuss the machinery needed at B to provide trust when A exchanges funds with C.  It was not clear whether there was any trusted connection between the two channels at B, namely B's view of (A,B)  and B's view of (B,C).    If they need to be coupled with a mutually trusted state machine, then there needs to be a single trusted execution environment at node B.  However, if funds can be exchanged between A and C without requiring a single trusted environment at B, then there would be no requirement for the two channels to have the same architecture, let alone same implementation.  Note that if the connection between the two channels has to be trusted, then a larger network is almost certainly going to require that all nodes trust each other through transitive closure.  This might require a mono culture and complete trust in all nodes, something that many people would consider a centralized system.\\n\\nIt would be helpful if the people working on TREchan would describe how trusted paths operate, which would at a bare minimum have to show how the simple three node network above would work, including all actions possible at nodes A, B and C, including malious actions by untrusted portions of the network.  \\n\\n\", \"A quick question: I didn't see it in the teechan paper, so I was wondering, does the 'setup' transaction need to be included in a block prior to the payment channel actually opening?\", 'There is a huge difference between trusting hardware for the security of the currency (which is what you were trying to insinuate) versus trusting hardware for the sums in payment channels (something that a lot of people are comfortable with, because the many tens-of-millions of dollars required for an attack would not justify the theft of hundreds to thousands of dollars).\\n\\nAnd hardware is always on the trusted path, unless you compute signatures by hand.\\n', \"&gt;You didn't understand what I wrote then.

There's room for bitcoin or something else to fulfill some niche needs in the value storage space, but when it comes down to it, people will always see gold as the primary storage of value.\", 'Great minds come to the same conclusion independently, somewhat dated [vintage 2013](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/19006/what-protocols-are-built-on-top-of-bitcoin/19016#19016) application of Exter\\'s Pyramid to cryptocurrency.

Last estimates were  ~$28T USD in flag M0 being available at Layer 2 worldwide, not all denominated in USD.

A **Nakamoto Consensus** between the majority of States accepting the application of cryptocurrencies will determine if cryptocurrencies will continue to thrive. It is all about timing of cryptocurrencies gracefully eaking their way in way into States without threatening States around the time of the \"big reset\".\\n\\nWhat States need to recognize is that micro accounting cyclic executive patterns (associated fiat flag currency income tax systems) are an order of magnitude less efficient than event driven patterns. This is Hayek\\'s vision of competing currencies coming to fruition, a deemphasis on Keynesian Economics, and the awakening to Austrian Economics in the age of the Internet with a smattering of the [Pathetic Dot Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_dot_theory).

However this does not change the fact that there are right now something like five billion ounces of gold in the world and there won't be more than twenty five million Monero in my life time.\\n\\nIn the above outlined scenario, a crypto currency is treated like a receipt for gold.

You cannot move it (easily) and cannot spend it (in most places). Monero is a store of value **and** a currency (assuming acceptance increases going forward). Why not just keep your money in Monero? Why risk buying gold? Gold is easier to confiscate and much more expensive to store in large amounts. You will also have added risk of losing it if someone else is holding it for you (as you say you can buy it without moving it). That would be similar to leaving your Monero on an exchange. If the exchange / gold storage goes down, bye bye money.\\n\\nFurther, what gives gold its value? What if people all of sudden decide they are not interested in gold anymore?

For commerce on the Internet, the ability to spend crypto is vastly superior to specie.  However, for direct human interactions maybe 1 in a 1000 people know how to use Bitcoin.  Normalizing the number of Monero Reddit users to Bitcoin users (~7K/200K), maybe one in ~30K people know how to use Monero.  With numbers like that, it is currently much easier to exchange specie in the physical world for trade for legal exchanges. Then there is also the branding problem.  No one will accept Monero if they don't know what it is.  The Gartner hype cycle for a currency is technology insensitive and will still be on the order of 10 years. Trust in a currency is gained at a snail's rate and lost in a gallop.\\n\\nFinally, the Monero network doesn't have as many full nodes running at any instant of time like Dash does.

The bitcoin community as a whole is quite small relative to other economic communities, and user optimization is key. Without the original bitcoin client software provided by Satoshi, and its numerous branchings since, we wouldn’t have the software to function, let alone thrive. And without the miners and enthusiasts utilizing such software to maintain and validate the blockchain, this community could not, and would not, exist.\\n\\nThere exist individuals who are versed in the multitudes of coding languages who are capable of understanding the efforts of the different development teams building bitcoin client software with scant effort on their parts.

Whether an individual may be a software developer, an enthusiast, a miner, a business owner, an entrepreneur, or the simplest of laymen, the different bitcoin clients are directly correlated to the experience and prosperity of each. However, it is important to note that this correlation between client software and bitcoin user occurs whether the user understands it or not.
